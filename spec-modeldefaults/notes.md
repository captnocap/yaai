have a default list of models/providers for populating ui
images (partially done)
color 
model names


when the user goes to fetch models to add to their list, they should be grouped by their underlying provider (eg. anthropic, openai, etc) and not their upstream provider (eg. nano-gpt, etc)
not every provider will have every model, these are just to get a general idea of what's available so that we can style the ui
